My search engine operates by sifting through an extensive dataset of TV show titles and descriptions to locate the best matches to user queries. Initially, it performs a cleaning operation on the dataset, stripping HTML tags and converting all text to lowercase to maintain uniformity. Subsequently, the engine tokenizes the text, breaking down sentences into individual words, and applies stemming to reduce words to their root form. This standardization process is crucial for enhancing the engine's ability to match different inflections and derivations of the same word, thereby improving the relevance of the search results.

I designed the search engine with efficiency and accuracy in mind. By employing techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), the engine can weigh the terms within the dataset and prioritize those that are more distinctive and relevant to the search queries. This approach ensures that common words with less significance don't overshadow key terms that could lead to more precise matches. The engine also uses cosine similarity to rank the results based on how closely the show's vector representation matches the query vector, which reflects the multi-dimensional nature of text data in a high-dimensional space. This methodical and analytical approach is aimed at delivering fast and pertinent search results that align closely with the user's intent.
