In developing my classifier, my goal was to accurately identify the various genres associated with TV show descriptions. I started this process by loading the data from a sqlite file, selecting only the relevant information from the tvmaze and tmaze_genre tables. After importing the data into pandas DataFrames, I created a one-hot-encoded matrix for the genre information and then merged it with the TV show descriptions. My preprocessing of the text was thorough—removing HTML tags, extraneous characters, and stopwords—to ensure the model would train on the most content-rich words.

The model itself was built thoughtfully using Keras and TensorFlow. I implemented a TextVectorization layer to convert the descriptions into token sequences and an Embedding layer to understand word relationships within the context of TV show genres. Although I initially considered an LSTM layer, I chose to keep the model simpler and more focused on capturing the essence of the text without delving into sequence modeling, which isn't strictly necessary for genre classification. For the output layer, I used a sigmoid activation function for each genre category to enable multi-label classification, recognizing that shows often belong to multiple genres simultaneously.

The structure of the model, including the use of EarlyStopping and a well-selected optimizer and loss function, was crafted to be efficient and effective. This is a reflection of my dedication to creating a model that is not only precise in its classification but also efficient in training, ensuring that it is robust enough to handle the nuanced task of multi-label text classification. Through this, I aimed to build a classifier that operates with a high degree of accuracy and can be relied upon to make sense of complex data relationships within TV show descriptions.

In practice, the model achieved a 50 percent accuracy rate, which, while a milestone, also highlighted its limitations. The performance indicated a certain level of instability in its predictions. This has been an insightful outcome, underscoring the need for further refinement. The architecture, inclusive of an EarlyStopping mechanism and a chosen adam optimizer and loss function, was envisioned to blend precision with training efficiency. However, the challenge remains to enhance the model's stability and improve its capability to consistently understand and categorize the complex patterns present in TV show descriptions for a more reliable multi-label classification.

In an effort to mitigate the volatility in the genre predictions from my classifier, I have implemented a tailored thresholding strategy in classifier.py. Upon generating predictions for a given description, the classifier assesses the confidence level of each genre assignment. Typically, only genres with a probability exceeding 0.5 would be considered as likely candidates. However, to adapt to the model's current level of accuracy and to ensure a more robust genre assignment, I have introduced a condition: if no genres meet the initial 0.5 threshold, the classifier then defaults to a lower threshold of 0.3. This allows the inclusion of genres that the model predicts with moderate confidence, thereby ensuring that a genre is assigned even in cases where the model's certainty is not at its peak. Subsequently, the genres are ranked by their probabilities, and the top three are selected to represent the description. This pragmatic approach acknowledges the classifier's present limitations while still leveraging its discernment to provide genre predictions with the available data.
